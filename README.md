## Project Description
This project aims to create a safer campus environment for all members of the Bilkent University to maintain face to face education covid pandemic. We aim to create a web application that offers:

* Management of HES codes, PCR, vaccine, and quarantine status of users
* Managing status of users who got in contact with covid diagnosed persons
* When students want to go to the gym, they can check the crowdedness of the gym’s every room (volleyball room, basketball room, fitness, etc.) and choose to go or not according to the crowdedness.
* Students enroll in their classes so that instructors can see their covid status.
* Students choose their seats in classrooms and will get a notification if they sit next to a covid diagnosed person.
* Users are able to get their vaccination status (for example, when a person can get 3rd vaccine appointment, they will get an alert indicating this).
* Users who did not get vaccinated will get an alert if they do not get their PCR tests on time.
* Users fill a form every day. This form includes questions about the covid symptoms and general well-being of the user. Using this form, if a user shows multiple covid symptoms for more than 5 days with 10 symptoms, the system wants a PCR test from that user. To make this form appealing to be filled every day by the students, there is a reward system. For instance, when a student fills the form they get points. When their points reach a certain point, they earn a reward. This reward can be coffee from the campus cafes. 
* As a feature, after users enter the campus,the application will get the information of which rooms they used: which classrooms, which toilets, which restaurants, which cafes, etc. Therefore by using this feature, administrative staff will see the rooms which are more likely to be exposed to virus and they can take action about that room. Reward system works in that section as well. When a user finishes their daily room history, they will get points.
* Users are able to see each dorm’s covid status anonymously, as a number. We created this feature to protect visiting students who use study rooms in dormitories. Users can see how many covid exposed students are in each dorm and each floor of the dorm.
